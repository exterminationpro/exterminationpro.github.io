In lots of establishing countries, where IPM is now governmental policy, pesticide use is being reduced.</p>
<p>When stored for a long time, kept product pests are most likely to be in a food active ingredient on delivery to a processing factory or a processed food product. Using pesticides to crops, animals, structures or landscapes on a regular basis, regardless of requirement, is not IPM.
