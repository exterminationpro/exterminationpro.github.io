<p>Biological control has actually been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with invasive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is normally used where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has actually been effectively used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Biological control techniques can also be seen as natural services as they do not depend on using pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is required due to the fact that insects and rodents carry illness, infest your kitchen areas and bedrooms, and bite you or your family pets.

Management choices must be based upon tracking and population levels of insect pests, along with reliable limits. IPM addresses all the economic, environmental, and social elements and offers safe and affordable food to the earnings and consumers to producers and sellers, while preserving ecological health.</p>
