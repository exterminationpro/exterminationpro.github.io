<p>Socio-psychological aspects consisting of moral and reasonable factors to consider were discovered to the drivers in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness incident and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that an absence of certified IPM experts and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM application in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and dissuade pest determination consist of intercropping (numerous crops in the exact same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
