Current experiences with bug pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for key examples in the conversation. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) refers to pest control and avoidance programs that depend on numerous synchronised approaches to obtain the preferred result.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can rapidly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered thus becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a wealthy area likely will have a lot of big, costly houses, so pest control costs could be higher there since there's more area for a pest control company to cover in one of those houses.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was thus associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be applied just after routine monitoring indicated that a pest population had actually reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would go beyond the expense of the control procedures.</p>
