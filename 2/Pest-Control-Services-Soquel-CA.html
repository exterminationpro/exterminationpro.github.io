The copying describes the six parts of an Integrated Pest Management program used to manage carpenter ants. Focusing mainly on long-lasting pest prevention, an effective IPM program uses a combination of control techniques including biological control, habitat control, modifications to cultural practices and use of resistant plant varieties.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and dissuade pest persistence consist of intercropping (numerous crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
