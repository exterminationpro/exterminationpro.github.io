<p>4 ). With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a ecologically benign and cost-efficient  pest control method ideally fit for both little and big farmers around the world. When termites have actually gotten in a building, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be considered as a decision-making process in which observations (from assessment and monitoring) are used to make pest control choices based upon pre-determined management objectives.</p>
<p>Utilizing natural enemies as an alleviative control is less effective compared to applying them preventively. Employ appropriate scouting methods and treatment choices to maintain the helpful insects that can offer additional insect pest control. Carefully keep track of fields for all pests to figure out the need for restorative insecticide treatments. Now long term efficient pest control is available on your fingertips.</p>
