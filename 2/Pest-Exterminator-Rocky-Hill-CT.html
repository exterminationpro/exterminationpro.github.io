<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is typically used where natural opponents from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).

Controls of insect reproductive systems methods such as sanitized bug strategy (SIT) and incompatible bug technique (IIT) offer environmental-friendly and ingenious approaches for IPM. Apply pesticides when they are most effective. Pests infect items, trigger structural damage, and are severe public health issues for houses and businesses.</p>
