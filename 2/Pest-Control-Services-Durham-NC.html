<p>There is no clear scientific evidence that consuming crop items stemmed from genetically engineered plants has caused harmful results to animals or people (e.g., 75% of all cheeses include chymosin, which is, and has been for a long time, produced with genetically engineered germs). In many developing countries, where IPM is now governmental policy, pesticide usage is being minimized.</p>
<p>Subsidies on pesticides were reduced from 75% in 1986 to 40% in 1987 and eliminated altogether by January 1989 (APO 1993). Biological control - indicates a normal way of ruining pests as it occurs in nature. Early detection of arthropod pests assists prevent the need to handle substantial populations that may cause crop damage. Safety problems and environmental interruptions continue to ensue (Wright, 1996 ), and there are restored appeals for effective, safe, and economically acceptable alternatives (Benbrook, 1996 ). Synthetic chemical pesticides are the most widely used method of pest control.</p>
