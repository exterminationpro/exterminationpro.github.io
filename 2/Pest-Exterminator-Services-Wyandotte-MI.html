<h3>Prevent Termites With Termite Pest Control Wyandotte MI</h3>
<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the safest for other organisms and for water, air, and soil quality; use pesticides in bait stations instead of sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds instead of a whole location.

<p>The concept of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for handling pests, has remained in practice for a long period of time.
