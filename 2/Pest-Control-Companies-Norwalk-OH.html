<p>IPM is used in farming, cultivation, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation and general pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and decorative pest management. Deal with a pest invasion with a hand sprayer, fertilize your turf with a granular spreader, deal with termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with a professional bait weapon, or apply pre-emergent herbicides with a backpack sprayer.</p>
