<p>There is no clear clinical proof that consuming crop items originated from genetically engineered plants has triggered damaging results to humans or animals (e.g., 75% of all cheeses include chymosin, which is, and has been for some time, produced with genetically engineered germs). In many developing nations, where IPM is now governmental policy, pesticide use is being decreased.</p>
<p>Subsidies on pesticides were decreased from 75% in 1986 to 40% in 1987 and removed altogether by January 1989 (APO 1993). Biological control - implies a normal method of ruining pests as it occurs in nature.

Periodical releases of commercially available natural opponents or conserving natural opponent populations by providing refuges or avoiding practices that damage them are a few of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
