<p>The determination of the right cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides toxic to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for specific insect types or life stages.</p>
<p>Extremely impressed with the professional technique of Sunlight Pest Control team, my house was terribly harmed by termite however they have actually done excellent job and they were really respectful. Insects, weeds, and illness can cause pricey and irreversible damage to livestock and crops. The insect pest control market is a fragmented one with a large number of domestic manufacturers, formulators, service, providers, and suppliers.</p>
<p>Normally, the primary objective of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, initially established for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now established to encompass illness, weeds, and other pests that might disrupt the management objectives of sites such as commercial and residential structures, lawn and turf areas, and home and community gardens.</p>
