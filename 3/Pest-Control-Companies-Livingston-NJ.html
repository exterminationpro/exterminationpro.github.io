<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, manage, and minimize risk from pests and pest management tools and techniques in such a way that lessens overall economic, health, and environmental threats.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and prevent pest persistence include intercropping (several crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household insect pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about minimizing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management tactics are unable to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have been regularly utilizing much of these IPM methods for decades and even generations - strategies such as crop rotation, not planting crops in areas prone to pests, or utilizing tolerant or resistant varieties. Sovereign Pest Control and its affiliated companies provide quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 property owners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee.</p>
