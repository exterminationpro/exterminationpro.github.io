These may or might not include materials listed on the Organic Materials Evaluation Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and especially insecticides utilized in organic farming and natural gardening are normally much safer than artificial pesticides, they are not always more ecologically friendly or safe than artificial pesticides and can cause damage.</p>
<p>In reference to the principle of incorporating making use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on widened to welcome coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).
