Specific biostimulants based on minerals, microorganisms, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart caused systemic resistance to pests, diseases, and abiotic stress factors, but are applied as modifications with no claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These new items or innovations can fall into one or more abovementioned classifications of pest management.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived hazardous metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical molecules, similar to synthetic chemicals, and possess a number of the ecological and human safety dangers as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>The professional user needs to keep making use of pesticides and other forms of intervention to levels that are necessary, e.g. by lowered doses, lowered application frequency or partial applications, considering that the level of danger in plants is appropriate and they do not increase the danger for development of resistance in populations of damaging organisms.</p>
