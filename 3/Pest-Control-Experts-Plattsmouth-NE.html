<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest issues, classical biological control technique is typically used where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).

<p>Usually, the main aim of IPM programmes is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, originally established for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now established to incorporate illness, weeds, and other pests that may interfere with the management objectives of sites such as business and residential structures, yard and turf locations, and home and neighborhood gardens.</p>
