This mix of IGRs can be effective in avoiding re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood uninteresting insects which, in a collection environment, may trigger major damage to structures, office furniture, artifacts and specimens. Applicators perform more intricate tasks, have the ability to utilize a wider variety of pesticides, and might focus on a certain location of pest control.</p>
