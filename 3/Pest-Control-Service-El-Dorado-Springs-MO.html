<p>WebMD veterinary specialists answer commonly asked concerns about fleas and ticks on your canine. Socio-psychological aspects including rational and ethical considerations were discovered to the motorists in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
