A great recordkeeping about pests, their damage, effective treatments, seasonal changes, interactions with ecological factors, irrigation practices, plant nutrition, and other associated details from year to year will develop the institutional understanding on a farm and prepares the grower to take curative or preventive actions.</p>
<p>The decision of the correct cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides harmful to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural enemies than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect types or life stages.</p>
<p>Natural opponents such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be really efficient in causing substantial decreases in pest populations in certain situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially offered natural enemies or saving natural enemy populations by supplying refuges or preventing practices that damage them are some of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
