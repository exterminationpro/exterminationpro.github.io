<p>Pests managed: Use horticultural oils to combat aphids, mites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Under EPM, chemicals must be utilized only as a last resort, after mechanical, cultural, and biological approaches have been tried and revealed inefficient. Various pest control chemicals are toxic and could be damaging, if not used appropriately.</p>
<p>Consider alternative methods (aside from pesticides) to make your house and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a structure. Current quests for efficient, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted primarily towards advancement of new and better products with which to change standard poisonous pesticides.</p>
<p>Using information about pests' biology and practices, together with a toolbox of pest management methods, pest control employees find, identify, and eliminate pests.
