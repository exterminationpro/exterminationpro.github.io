This component deals with the management aspect of the new IPM model for data collection, company, and actual actions versus pest problems. This focuses on keeping an eye on the life process and frequency of pests to identify the best pest control approaches for the present and following growing season.</p>
<p>It keeps the use of pesticide and other interventions to levels that are economically and ecologically warranted and reduces threats to human health and the environment. In a metaanalysis of data of 145 studies, the effectiveness of either parasitoids or predators was demonstrated to be good in lowering the variety of pests and increasing pest death (Stiling and Cornelissen, 2005).</p>
