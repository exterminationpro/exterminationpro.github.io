If outsourced, the food business should understand it has an equal function to play in pest control" with the pest management professional, states Dr. Siddiqi.</p>
<p>The expert user should keep the use of pesticides and other kinds of intervention to levels that are necessary, e.g. by decreased dosages, decreased application frequency or partial applications, considering that the level of risk in plant life is appropriate and they do not increase the threat for development of resistance in populations of hazardous organisms.</p>
<p>A comprehensive understanding of general IPM principles and various management options for all possible pest problems is necessary as some are preventive and others are curative. We generally suggest pest control chemicals that finish the job utilizing the least quantity of product. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last hope).
