<p>The habits of the pest can be exploited for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and breeding interruption techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). Baits including dangerous material will attract and kill the pests when distributed in the field or put in traps.</p>
<p>It is a proactive approach to managing pests," states Dr. Siddiqi, and utilizes chemicals only as a last hope. Lots of pest control workers start as assistants and gain on-the-job training. Nests and hives: When you can see hives and nests in and around your home, it means that there are a lot of pests doing their grunt work. The main technique is to promote advantageous insects that eat or parasitize target pests.</p>
<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be extremely effective in triggering considerable reductions in pest populations in certain circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural enemies or conserving natural enemy populations by supplying sanctuaries or avoiding practices that harm them are some of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>Chemical insecticides were to be utilized in the manner least disruptive to biological control. After handling numerous nationwide chain exterminators and being largely disappointed with the service, I relied on Terminators for aid with pest problems at my workplace. The concept of IPM is to keep an eye on and control pests just when they start appearing and getting rid of the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM methods, Scope of works, application methods and industry specific record keeping procedures.</p>
