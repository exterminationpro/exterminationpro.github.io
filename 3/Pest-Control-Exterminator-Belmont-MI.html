Because 2003, most of brand-new pesticide registrations have actually satisfied requirements set by EPA for decreased danger" consisting of lower hazards to human health and non-target organisms, and reduce potential for contamination of groundwater, surface water, and other ecological resources.</p>
<p>These unknown or poorly understood potential threats argue for additional levels of defense including direct exposures to numerous pesticides, at home, at school and in the diet; direct exposure to chemicals in mix with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial compounds and personal care items; and the basic trouble in attributing persistent health problems to any one particular cause.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home bug pests.
