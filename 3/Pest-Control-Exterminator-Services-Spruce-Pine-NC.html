<p>More info is needed about food-chain concentration and practical ways of getting rid of harmful results of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have served their purpose.

Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode ruin roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy leaves and berries originating from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
<p>Saved item pests are more than likely to be in a food component on delivery to a processing factory or a processed food product when stored for a long period of time.
