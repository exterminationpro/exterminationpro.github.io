The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to illness, arthropods, and weeds, though challenged by some as a legitimate procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the augmentation of pest control.</p>
<p>The service received (Cockroach control) was extremely prompt and professional. When pest or diseases levels are low and actions most efficient, early detection of illness and pests leads to prompt action.
