<p>For some tasks, pest control employees use a combination of pest management strategies, a practice referred to as integrated pest management. The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine evaluations. Crop losses due to diseases, weeds, and arthropods, though challenged by some as a legitimate measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the climax of pest control.</p>
<p>Some likewise recognized that if regionally collaborated IPM might happen, even annual management of a consistent pest could be made more effective (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We hire exterminators who focus on industrial or industrial pest control. Continuous training and education of farmers represent the foundation for facility of efficient and solid IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
