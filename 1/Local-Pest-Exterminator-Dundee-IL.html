<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home pest pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being practically exclusively about reducing pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management techniques are unable to keep an insect pest population below a financial limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Usually, the main aim of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, originally developed for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now established to include illness, weeds, and other pests that may interfere with the management goals of sites such as residential and commercial structures, lawn and turf locations, and house and community gardens.</p>
