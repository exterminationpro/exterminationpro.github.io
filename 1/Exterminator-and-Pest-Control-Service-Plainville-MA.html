	 <title>Exterminator and Pest Control Service Plainville MA</title>
	<meta name="description" content="Nearest Pest Control in Plainville MA - The degree of damage depends on the growing season and environmental conditions ( Khaliq et al., 2014 ). One pest species, Yellow Stem Borer (YSB-Scirpophaga incertulas; Lepidoptera Crambidae), is considered to be a major rice pest ( Chatterjee and Mondal, 2014 ). Rice plants damaged by this insect develop unhealthy tillers and hills, Dead Heart (central leaf drying), and White Head (grain-less panicles), all of which affect the overall yield ( Satpathi et al., 2012 ). According to DAE (2011) YSB populations can be reduced through several IPM methods, including: light trapping (placing a light source inside a funnel-shaped trap), hand picking eggs from rice leaves (Leaves with egg masses are removed from plants by hand during tillering and booting stages), sweeping (using a funnel shaped net to capture insects), perching (installing a branch or pole which serves as a resting place for predatory birds), cultivation of insect resistant rice varieties, using bio-agents releasing predator insects such as Long horned grasshopper Conocephalus longipennis (Haan), applying Economic Threshold Level (ETL) based insecticides (The ETL is the point at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest).">
