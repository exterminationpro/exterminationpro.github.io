<p>In Asia, different phases of IPM have actually been effectively embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>In reference to the idea of integrating making use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on broadened to accept coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Tighter policies for food security, occupational health and safety, and the environment suggest in-house pest control isn't a choice for lots of food companies these days. Farmers are faced with myriad of production challenges where the most typical problems are pests, that include weeds, illness, and insects. Similarly, pest and crop management disciplines should work together to establish control recommendations that reflect these interactions.</p>

If you present any situation with pests, companies with emergency situation numbers will be the finest ones to hire since they will be prepared for you. This topic is dis- cussed in Chapter 18. Specific pesticide residues may remain in the environment for many years. Pests multiply in number extremely quickly, making it chaos to eliminate. The very first signs of pests in your home should alert you to reserve a professional pest control specialist at the earliest.</p>
