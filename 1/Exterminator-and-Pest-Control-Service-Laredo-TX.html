IPM is most likely to be misunderstood as pest management without chemicals which in truth requirement based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the components or packaging, and the facility itself will bring in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>

<p>Some also recognized that if regionally collaborated IPM could take place, even yearly management of a consistent pest might be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We hire exterminators who focus on business or commercial pest control. Constant training and education of farmers represent the foundation for establishment of reliable and strong IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is usually used where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been effectively utilized versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
