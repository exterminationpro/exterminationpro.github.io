<p>The benefits of Integrated Pest Management are enormous directly to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control involves the use of living organisms to control a pest population. Do not blend pesticides. There are four major elements in the brand-new IPM model that deal with numerous pest management options, the understanding, and resources the grower needs to deal with the pest issue, planning and organization of details to take appropriate management actions, and preserving great communication to acquire and disseminate understanding about pests and their management.</p>
