<p>They are selected and used in a method that avoids interfering with other IPM practices if pesticides are required. Almost every kind of pest poses a danger to the residential or commercial properties they populate, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the implementation of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
