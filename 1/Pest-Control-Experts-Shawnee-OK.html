Besides regular external spraying, whenever there was believed to be a risk of a pest problem establishing, there was no documented or routine pest control program at MTSL at the time of the preliminary audit.</p>
<p>We traditionally have sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the efficiency of ecologically unsound methods in addition to its variety of intrinsic strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, stress of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thus increasing the likelihood that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>

<p>They are chosen and applied in a method that avoids interrupting other IPM practices if pesticides are necessary. Almost every type of pest postures a danger to the homes they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the execution of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
