Consideration of crop plants as active elements of multitrophic level interactions is crucial to a total systems approach to pest management. Business pest control companies have obligations that go far beyond that of handling and removing pests.</p>
<p>Current studies document the requirement for ongoing decreases in hazardous pesticide usage and practices.
