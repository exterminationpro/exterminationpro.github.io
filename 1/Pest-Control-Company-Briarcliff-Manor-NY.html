SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, may trigger serious damage to structures, office furnishings, specimens and artifacts. Applicators carry out more complicated tasks, have the ability to use a larger range of pesticides, and might concentrate on a certain area of pest control.</p>
