<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al.

<p>Biological control has actually been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest issues, classical biological control method is usually used where natural enemies from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has actually been effectively used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Typically, the primary goal of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ).
