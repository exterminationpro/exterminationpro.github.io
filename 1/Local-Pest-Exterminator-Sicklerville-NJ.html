<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest issues, classical biological control technique is generally used where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been efficiently utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>A service strategy like Economy Exterminators' Overall Pest Control program is the only truly effective way to eliminate pests and prevent them from coming back.

Local termite pest control company utilize inexpensive chemicals that just fend off termites and trigger them to spread out even more while harming your property.
