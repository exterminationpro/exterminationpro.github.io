For instance, a rich community likely will have a lot of big, costly houses, so pest control costs could be greater there because there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in among those houses.</p>
<p>Pest control is a very crucial step owing to the fact that a number of pests are providers of damaging disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the obliteration of a few pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).
