<h3>Commercial Pest Control Companies Rigby Idaho</h2>
<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest problems, classical biological control approach is generally utilized where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been successfully used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have actually been regularly using a number of these IPM strategies for years or even generations - strategies such as crop rotation, not planting crops in locations susceptible to pests, or utilizing tolerant or resistant ranges. Sovereign Pest Control and its affiliated companies offer quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 homeowners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee.</p>
