<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) has actually had a different history, with various definitions. In truth, some synthetic pesticides (e.g., synthetic pyrethroids vs pyrethrins and neonicotinoids vs nicotine) are produced mimicing the pesticidal particles of natural origin.

While none of these insects is a direct risk to collections, carcasses of large-bodied insects might act as a food source for carpet beetle larvae and mice.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production applies a number of the exact same principles as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals.
