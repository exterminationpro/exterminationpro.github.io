<p>In Asia, numerous stages of IPM have been successfully embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>The method to be picked for IPM depends upon many elements, the important of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic element of the management. Insect pests cause substantial losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If standard home hygiene is neglected, the impacts of other types of pest control will be exceptionally brief as the pests will quickly be back, and in higher numbers.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control family insect pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly exclusively about reducing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management strategies are unable to keep an insect pest population below an economic threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is justified.</p>
