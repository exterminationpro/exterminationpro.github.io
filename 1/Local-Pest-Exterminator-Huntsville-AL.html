However, the high potential for recreation of insect pests remains, and a population surge of lots of species can be anticipated from a low-density level whenever suitable environmental conditions take place or control slackens. Under this scheme, pest control was "monitored" by certified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from regular tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>

<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a procedure that is utilized to control pest populations while decreasing the effect on people and the surrounding environment. Though there is a controversy of utilizing chemicals due to environmental contamination it is a fact that this is the only technique which is commonly accepted and offered effective control of pest.</p>

Many pesticide problems are triggered by a little number of the pesticides readily available today.</p>
