If your center presently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be amazed to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact services and products.</p>

Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
